# Introduction

Hello. We are a group of people from the [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org) project. BZFlag has been a ton of fun, but is no longer viable as a project and needs new life. Our goal is to create a new game that brings over the fun elements from BZFlag, but that also feels fresh and modern and meets the expectations of modern users. We are using this repository to lay out design specifications for this project, which will be used to guide development efforts and provide a clear vision for what we want to accomplish. These plans are a work in progress and updates may occur as designs are created and refined.

If this project interests you, please be aware that we will need help in many forms from people with many different skills. Specifically, we want help from experienced programmers, artists, level designers, and people with knowledge about build systems/IDEs, network abuse prevention, legal issues for open-source projects, etc. Even without those specific skills, people who are willing to build and test unstable development code on their systems can be a great benefit to the project once source code is generated and the usable product begins to take shape.

# Contact

During this initial phase, we will be using this repository for content and will leverage GitHub's various social tools (such as comments) for discussion and collaboration. Additionally, discussion will take place on the ##teamchillax channel on the Freenode IRC network.
