# Design Guidelines

This document will cover the basic high level design guidelines for the project. They are intended to help designers and developers create clean and consistent designs that are understandable and implementable.

# Guidelines

## Solve problems first
Every aspect of a design must solve some problem. In order to do this, it is important to make sure that the problem that is being solved is clearly stated. Issues can arraise when solutions are presented with out a clear problem defintion.

When designing a feature always start with the problem definition, and then show how the solution solves the problem. This will make the project must more solid and sound in the long run. Clear problem definitions will help us know in the end if we have implemented a system correclty as designed.

### Consider all solutions
There will always be multiple ways to solve problems, we want to make sure that all of them are considered. If some solutions are clearly inferior, it is best to document why, so that other designers and developers can understand the choices made.

## Use the best solution for the project as a whole.
The overall goal of design and development is to make the best proejct possible. To this end, when considering multiple solutions do not discard solutions just because they are unfamilar or someone "just doesn't like them".

In order for the proejct to be the best it can be, it needs the best solutions, from any source, as long as they meet the requirements.

### Basic solution requirements
All solutions must meet the fooling requiremsnets in addition to specific ones needed by the module/component.

  1. Solves the problem
  2. Is maintainable
  3. Is flexable
  
  ## Comment on designs
  Just because a design is writen doesn't mean it is set in stone. Comment on the design if you see problems, use the tools we have available. THe entire point of a public design is to get feedback.
  
  ### Respect comments added to your designs
  People are going to comment on designs, reasonalbe input must be respected. If a design is solid then it is easy to defend critisisms. If the comments bring up valid points, refine the design.
  
  ### Respect the final choices
  If reasonable comments have been provided and the design has bene finalized, perhaps even with compromises, respect the choice and try to understand the reasons why it was made. We don't want endless fighs over features, somtimes we just have to pick a method.
  
  ## Users provide ideas, contributors provide implemenations
  Input from users and players is awesome, they have a wealth of informaiton we need to tap. We should get ideas from users whenever possible, but we should only take the general idea, not specific implementations. Designers and developers must take an idea and break it down into a problem/solution scenario. This way we continue to pick the best solution to implement the idea, not just the one a user had.
  
  ## Get inspriation from everywhere
  We all love bzflag for some reason or another and we are going to pull inspriation from it. BZFlag is not the only game that we can/should pull inspriation from. If other games or proejcts have good ideas, we should evaluate them as well. BZFlag is a game, if we are pulling ideas from games, we can use any game.
